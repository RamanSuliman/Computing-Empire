				<h2> Operating Systems </h2>
				<p>
					An operating system is defined as a set of programs that control, monitor 
					and support computer equipments in term of runing application packages such as
					word or spreadsheet, where it’s is the most important program that runs 
					on any computer. Giving the ability to the programmers of the 
					<abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> to apply
					changes or update when needed. As It’s performs basic tasks when it’s the
					responsible for input devices such as keyboard where it gives instruction
					and sent it to output screen display, however larger operating system you
					have larger responsibilities and powers it got. A computer can operate 
					only when the operating system that loads from secondary memory to the 
					main memory when the device is turned on to start running the device. As
					it’s connecting appropriately between <abbr title="Basic Input Output System">BIOS</abbr> and the applications software
					in the way to control the hardware components and run them perfectly. The
					main control program in the operating system is the supervisor, it is 
					known as the Monitors or the Executive which is responsible for directing
					activities to all parts of the operating system. It holds a program from
					a device to establish a system main memory.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h2> Purpose of operating system: </h2>
				<p>
					The purpose of any operating system is to enable communication between
					the computer and the user through the user interface that is in the form
					of commands given by the user to the device command base. Operation system
					also making the communication between computer components easier where it
					gives smooth movement of internal instruction and data between peripherals
					, programs, processors and storage devises so it’s making the action of 
					input, out and secondary storage easier. Overall, provides system 
					protection where it allows or prevent the access of a user to the computer
					system or to get to any file stored in it by setting up a password and 
					username on the computer or on documents to secure user data.

				in various places such as schools, companies or homes too because it 
				fixable to be learn and smooth to be used. Overall, Windows 7 is likely
				to be the most suitable system for programming and coding where you have
				fully control on the <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC's</abbr> to run codes. 
			</p>
			<h4> Strength of Windows 7 </h4>

				<li> Code can be changed with anyone those who holding the right knowledge. </li>
				<li> More secure and less prone to viruses. </li>
				<li> Good technical support through internet advisors, also Full use of hard disk.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4> Weakness of Linux </h4>
			<ul>
				<li> Lack of business applications. </li>
				<li> Functions are not always well documented and can be frustrating to a new administrator. </li>

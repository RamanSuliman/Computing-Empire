						-Firewall is the tool defender against unauthorised access to user <a href="Computer-System.html"> computer system </a> where
						 providing fully protection. It has two network interfaces (external and internal side) and it’s the responsible
						 of data that been allowed to move from one side to another (traffic passing). This leads to stop hackers to 
						 access and reach the materials on user computer. However, without adequate preparation the firewall often becomes useless.
					</td>
					<td> 
						-(Firewalls): Supporting the system with protection against any unnecessary data to access and being processed in
						 user computer ends up with effective outcomes such as computer system can run faster without wasting time to interpret data
						 which are not for use. Monitoring the bad traffic that contains malware by prevent them entering into the system so the user
						 could have the ability to look into the data of certain packet types. Additional on that it’s the most suitable tool to stop
						 hackers playing around the victim system by making a thick safe wall between user data and hackers data which containing malware
						 codes.

					<td>  -Virus protection- is the program that used to detect malware such as computer viruses and computer warms to prevent them
						from damaging the computer or stealing personal data by removing or repairing it, where it can fight spyware and other 
						forms of malwares. Usually hackers are using lines of codes which have the ability to harm the system but this would be 
						detected when anti-virus program is open so could make full scan over computer data and kill unauthorised codes that been 
						added. An example of that would be when downloading a program or browsing on the internet this would be a chance of the 
						virous to entry user computer therefor virus protection function to prevent that. </td>
					<td> - (Virus protection): The ability to access internet and download programmers or files securely without letting any virus to 
						 sneak in your computer system. Whereas, will also improve the performance of the user computer because of preventing malware
						 from invading and would get rid of any malware in case detected. Overall, it will reject any spam mail you might receive and 
						 would ensure that your email inbox contains only what you wish to receive because the inbox might be filled up with unwanted 
						 emails which might be containing viruses. In case of using computer without virus protection and any virus accessed the user 
						 system the processing power would confuse because of running the code repeatedly and resulted with slow performance speed.</td>

					<td class="animation_type"> Drive formatting </td>
					<td> The process of reading and writing data that used by computer where are based on two stages logical and physical formatting. 
						 Logical formatting is the technique that tells the hard drive how to store data where it places a file system on the disk when 
						 hard disk been physically formatted. As it’s giving the ability to an operating system to use the available space in the disk
						 to store and retrieve files. Physically formatting is the technique that scans over hard drive seeking behind defective parts 
						 of the drive and sets them to prevent data be corrupted as it usually performed by the manufacture. 
					</td>
					<td> Is providing the benefit of improving computer performance by setting up a storage device which has been formatted so would 
						 work perfectly. After formatting the hard drive, the software program issues and glitches must disappear resulted significant 
						 improvement on the performance. As well as, formatting the hard drive would make the computer to store data quicker in a predefined
						 file system resulted decreasing the amount of time seeking behind a place to store the data you wish in.

					<td class="animation_type"> Clean-Up Tools  </td>
					<td> Internet history- Is when a user is accessing web pages on internet to work on it constantly so those pages would be copied into
						 a temporary internet files which stored in the hard drive. By storing those pages, the user can easily open and load them faster 
						 than accessing pages again. However, the temporary internet files can eat a lot of space on the hard drive and lead to slow down
						 the performance, therefor the user has to make sure those files have been deleted to save drive so keep everything work fast.
					</td>
					<td> By getting rid of internet history files your hard drive would get more free space which in turns will let your computer to operate
						 faster because the amount of data that been stored in the history file are becoming useless after use and better to be deleted.
						 Therefor the user most remove all the internet history files that aren’t been visited usually otherwise will have negative impact
						 on the performance of the browser.

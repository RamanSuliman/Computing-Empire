					<h2> <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics"> PNG </abbr> </h2>
					<h4> Definition: </h4>
					<p> Is a shortcut of “Portable Network Graphics” lately been used massively due
						to the high ability to compress images sizes. Majority of websites are dealing with <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics"> PNG </abbr> images because it
						has small file size which means the site can be loaded faster. *<abbr title="World Health Organization">PNG</abbr> deals with large number of colours which can reach about 16 million colours.
						*Can be effectively used with layers in software like Adobe Fireworks.
						*Ability to compress image files better than <abbr title="Graphic Interchange Format"> GIF </abbr> which means the file comes with very small size.
						*Can’t be used to create animation where only can support still images.
						*Can be functioning in limited websites depending on the capability of supporting <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics"> PNG </abbr> content or not.
						*Unsuitable for large images because the file size would come up massive which isn’t preferable.

					<h2> <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group"> JPEG </abbr> </h2>
					<h4> Definition: </h4>
					<p> Means “Joint Photographic Experts Group” is a compressed bitmapped file type.
						It used by digital cameras and other photo capturing devices where it’s the most common format used for those devices. 
						*The <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group"> JPEG </abbr> file format keeps the picture quality high beside a little degree of compression.
						*Keeps the file size reduced due to the compression it applies on images without effecting the quality.
						*It can be working with different software as it’s compatible with nearly every computer program and photo modifier.	
						*Doesn’t support transparency functionality.
						*Normally produce larger image size than needed which means issuing spacing matter.
						*Over time, it’s degrading saved files after each saving.

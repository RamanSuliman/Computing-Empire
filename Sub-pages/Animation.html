						<td class="animation_type"> Kinescope </td>
						<td> 
								The term “Kine” stands for word kinetic which means motion.
								As it’s a recoding process that record a TV broadcast on
								a film reel that would be displayed later the TV screen as vivid video.
								This process worked by placing a video monitor in front of a TV and synchronising
								with screen refresh rate. It runs 24-30 frames per second even that it was given
								very poor quality, but it was still public method for showing TV products.   
						</td>
						<td> 
								This technique been used during the world war two by different countries in order
								to persuade the public of their victories “Propaganda war”.
								Moreover, during 1950 Kinescopes was one of the best technique in 19s because of 
								having high frame rate. 
						</td>
						<td> 
								I think that Kinescope was extremely important in a period where people were able to
								watch the program over and over. Plus, was useful to generalise ideas and points
								on TVs so people can watch and learn from. However, it was still improper devise
								to pass the images with high quality and requires heavy large equipment for recording.  
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="animation_type"> Zoetrope </td>
						<td> 
								This term stands for “Zoe” which means life and “Trope” means turn in English language,
								as it’s a wheel controlled by a person who can spin it while it has a strip inside it.
								The strips are helping to create an illusion of movement because it holds images made
								frame by frame so when it starts spinning, it will create an animation view. However,
								it requires a person to allow this wheel to spin those still images and create short
								animation scene. Furthermore, the animation technique can run only with 12 frames per
								second compare it with other techniques it has very low speed in term of moving frames per second. 
						</td>
						<td> 
								It’s the wheel of life that created first time as simple physical device been made to reflect 2D
								images which can easily animate still images. However, Zoetrope can only work with 2D images 
								where it doesn’t able to make 3D show. As well as,
								this devise is easy to build by humans which doesn’t need heavy equipment or costing items.
						</td>
						<td> 
								5, In the past Zoetrope was available for a period but it wasn’t popular. After few years it 
								became a massively popular where people started using it as entertainment method for children.
								Also, businessmen were using it as advertisement method to create an illusion of movements
								views their products. However, it’s not coveted much in our current time because of having powerful
								technology devices that works much faster and contains software such as “Photoshop” that includes more
								customizing tools in it. Zoetrope require great drawing skills which is tough for beginners to build and
								apply new projects in.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="animation_type"> Flip- Book </td>
						<td> 
								It’s the illusion of movements that shows continuous motion which is animation. It used instead of viewing
								a series of images frame by frame, so the user won’t just show images individuals to express the idea but
								can let seem as short scene made by flipping pages. The flick book works when a person star at the book
								while user flipping the pages with his thumb at a suitable speed rate to seem as real movements as typically
								gives 15 frames per second.  
						</td>
						<td> 
								Backing to 18th century the flip book mostly used to entertain children by drawing a series of images views
								animation movements. Also, used as award where in some local challenges the winner awarded with a flip book
								contains winner images running towards the cup and hold it up so it can be such as memory card beside the cup. 
						</td>
						<td> 
								I would rate this technique with 9 because it doesn’t require large equipment as it was easy to make with simple cost.
								However, it still tough to be created because the user must be holding professional drawing skills to share his work
								in best fit. Flip book can only produce short movie sequences and book papers can be damaged easily so the user would
								definitely loss his images and must recreate it.  
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="animation_type"> Rotoscoping </td>
						<td> 
								It was invented by Max Fleischer and Dave Fleischer during 1917 who worked on this technique until it took name which
								“Rotoscoping” and became common for a period. Is a technique been used in the past by animators to check the action
								of live footage as they were tracing the picture motion frame by frame. The process worked by projecting a sequence
								of film images on a glass panel then action the film, so the user can get the needed frames. This technique is holding
								better frame rate compare it with other animation techniques where it shows 24 frames per second. 
						</td>
						<td> 
								This technique used by animators who were seeking behind creating live-action movies from the frames that been redrawn.
								Where Disney studios during the history produced animated movie called “Snow White” which became famous as first animated movie. 
						</td>
						<td> 
								I would rate it with 4 out of 10, it has been successful in the past but in our current days the computer took place and produce
								movies with less effort, cost and equipment. However, it still called rotoscoping nowadays, but no one is using it as all remaining
								rotoscoping are in museums to be as historic devise used in past. 
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="animation_type"> Stop-Frame </td>
						<td> 
								Is animation that been captured with one frame by time while physical objects moved between frames. The user should physically move
								an animation and get one photograph of it and redo this step for the rest of frames than merging those frames to produce illusion
								of movements. However, this can only display 12 frames per second not powerful as Rotoscoping but same as Zoetrope technique.
						</td>	
						<td> 
								It mostly used to create animation movies for children such as “King Kong”. The animators were producing their characters with clay
								that used commonly to create those kinds of movies in the past.
						</td>
						<td> 
								Give it 7 out of 10 because it was highly important to express stories to the public and especially children. However, it doesn’t have
								value now because technology took power in this filed, this technique is time consuming.
						</td>							
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="animation_type"> Claymation  </td>
						<td>
								It named as cartoon in children field, as it’s same as stop frame technique but the different is using clay to produce objects as characters
								shaped by clay. Moreover, it’s an early form of video animation where children still prefer it nowadays even though it has low frame
								rate only 15 FPS. Animator won’t be under pressure from cost side because it can easily be recycled and create other models from same clay.
						</td>	
						<td> 
								This technique is typically used to create cartoons such as “Chicken Run” for children. Yes, it’s easy to make but in case of forming movies or
								animation it will be very time consuming and effortful due to the number of frames needed to get. As it requires 12 changes for every second!
						</td>
						<td>
								I would rate it 7 out of 10 because the animation and movies which this technique produce never seem natural. As, before the growth of advanced
								computer animation technologies, Claymation was playing a very important role in term of forming physical and 3D animation.
						</td>				
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="animation_type"> Drawn-on Film </td>
						<td>
								It’s kind of direct animation that can be created without using any camera. By using this technique, the footages will be produced by drawing or
								creating images on a film stock. However, this is different than other animation technique where others are photographing images or object
								frame by frame and obviously using animation camera for this task. Furthermore, there are two main methods often used to produce animation
								directly on film (One starts with blank film stock) and (starts with black prepared film). Overall, it has same frame rate as flip book and
								Zoetrope with the rate of 12 FPS which considered as poor rate.
						</td>
						<td>
								It has close similarity to flick-book technique, where both techniques require drawing but one on reel and other flip-book. However, drawing
								on film technique used to produce films and animation. As in 1946, Harry Smith have produced hand painted films which increased the popularity
								of using this technique because it was successfully produced by famous animator. 
								</td>
						<td>I would rate this technique with 7 out of 10 because yes artists can create excellent results, but few people can work on it as it requires
								drawing skills. More than that, it’s simple for animators to create simple and easy animation. However, to dig into depth and produce complex
								animation you will need many layers which is bad.
								</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="animation_type"> CGI </td>
						<td>
								It’s a process of using computer software for producing and generating animated images. Those generate can be dynamic images and static scenes
								where animator capable to chose based on needs. In addition to this, animators have more controllable ability to create, customize effects
								and direct their animation much more freely than other physical processes. The process of creating illusion of movements, an image of animation
								would be displayed and constantly replaced by newer image which share similarity but advanced somewhat. This animation technique has valuable frame
								rate up to 48 FPS which much better than other physical animation techniques.
						</td>
						<td>
								It used effectively and powerfully in the field of creating and producing movies, games and films. It had and still has massive popularity when needed
								to create a real person or fiction person as animation in now days movies. An example can be “Hulk” the green beast which favourited and liked by
								children and adults because of manipulating the animation in best fit by using computer animation software. 
						</td>
						<td>
								I think this deserved to be rated 10 out of 10 because it allows the animator to be more creative by using the software tools to develop and adjust
								the animation as wanted. As it easy to edit and enhance easily when dealing with big projects. However, to be implement that you need to spend
								a lot and requested enhanced digital graphics skills. Overall, I consider it as best animation technique so far.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="animation_type"> Cell Animation </td>
						<td>
								It’s a traditional form of animation and one of the oldest animation that have been found. It used in the past to create and product cartoons
								or animated movies, whereas each frame of the scene been drawn by hands. After drawing animation, animator would than put them at the top of each
								other such as layers and move them based on where they decided their cartoon to go. In addition to this cell animation has good frame rate where
								it runs 24 FPS. 
						</td>
						<td>
								This technique been used well in term of producing cartoons for children mostly such as “Snow White” in 1937 and “Sleeping Beauty” in 1959. Even
								that those were entertaining children but if you back to old cartoons you would notice that the background won’t move because they were only moving
								character and objects.
						</td>
						<td>
								I would rate this technique with 9 out of 10 because I consider it as best animation technique in term of producing cartoons for children.
								As well as, cell won’t get damage while applying animation on it. However, it’s very time consuming and require lots of organisation and look closer to
								details.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="animation_type"> 2D </td>
						<td>
								It’s a shortcut of two-dimensional animation and occurs since late 1800s. As majority of animation techniques used to create 2d animation were flick book,
								cell animation, rotoscoping, flash animation and drawn on film. It requires creativity and technological skills, so you can work on 2d animation filed.
								This technique focuses on producing storyboards, backgrounds and characters only in two-dimensional environment. However, 2d animation won’t appear to
								move toward or away from the viewer as how it would be in 3d animation. An example of that would be having a ball and wants to show all sides such as below
								it and above you must be drawing each side by it’s on while in 3d just need to move the camera around the ball.
						</td>
						<td>
								This technique has been used from the past until our now days to distribute business advertisements, where can be included an image of product in 2d shape only
								showing one side beside some other details related to their produce. As well as widely used to produce films like “The lion king”. Beside other type of usage
								in television shows, computer games, or websites.
						</td>
						<td>
								I think this technique deserves 10 out of 10 because it has been successfully used since been made. It assists people to be in touch with outside world shows
								through TVs, it benefits others to produce and spread movies, cinema events and series around the world. However, now days 3D has come up with better features
								such as showing a picture from all sides which is closer to reality than 2D.

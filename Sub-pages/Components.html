			<h3> Motherboard </h3>
			<p>
				It’s the mother of computer hardware components also known as (the heart
				of computer) where all of them based on it and this the reason of calling
				it motherboard. The function of the motherboard is to connect and control
				all the essential elements of any computer device such as 
				<abbr title="Central Processing Unit"> CPU</abbr>, hard disk,
				memory and video card by allowing them to receive power then communicate
				them with each other so they could run correctly.

			<h3> Hard disk drive (HDD </h3>
			<p>
				It’s non-volatile memory hardware and it consist of numbers of platters
				based on the needs which data is written using a magnetic head.
				The main purpose of it is to keep your files which contains data and 
				information’s save so when you turn off your <abbr title="Personal Computer"> PC</abbr> you will not lose them. 
				However, it’s not the only permanent storage which could store data in 
				there are other type of storages does the same function such as CD ROM 
				or floppy disk.

			<h3> Power supply unit (SPU) </h3>
			<p>
				The device which suppling electric energy to the internal components of 
				computer as it’s connecting with the motherboard. Which is converting 
				<abbr title="Alternating Current"> AC</abbr>
				to low-voltage to run devices and its passing electric energy to electric
				load. The functions of this device are to keep the power inside and 
				convert it then pass power to the pc components based on how much each
				part needs to work on. An example 12V would be giving to devices such as
				fan, heatsink, etc.

			<div class="anim_box3">
			<h3> Fan ---&--- Heatsink </h3>
			<p>
				It’s an electronic device mix either a fan or Peltier to keep a hot 
				component such as processor cool so it won’t get damaged. The key role of
				it is to look after coolness of the computer and make sure is cool enough
				to don’t ruin other computers components. While the heatsink is responsible
				to push out the temperature which might case overheating.

			<h3> Physical Ports </h3>
			<p>
				They are defined as the female part of connection where they are useful
				because they are allowing other devices to connect with the computer. 
				This connect could be by a plug such as <abbr title="Universal Serial Bus"> USB </abbr>
				or cables where mouse, 
				printer and other devices could connect. Therefore, physical ports are 
				external ports that could be reach without moving computer cabinet.

			<h3> System bus </h3>
			<p>
				The Bus system is a communications path located on the motherboard that
				links the component which are based on the motherboard together. 
				The motherboard carrying different kind of buses including an address
				bus, instruction bus and data bus which each one of them has different
				action to do with such as linking the motherboard with 
				<abbr title="Central Processing Unit"> CPU</abbr> or <abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM </abbr>.

			<h3> Random access memory (RAM) </h3>
			<p>
				<abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr> is considered as temporary memory where it stored temporally programs
				runs and losing those data while the computer turns off, however <abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr> is 
				begging used by <abbr title="Central Processing Unit"> CPU</abbr>
				when a computer runs programs it’s enabling the <abbr title="Central Processing Unit"> CPU</abbr>
				to access instructions and data stored in memory very fast. As well as 
				it’s the source speed of the computer. much you get higher 
				<abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM </abbr> much you
				could open more programs and run them faster. It’s placed on the 
				motherboard and provides the memory space for operating system and 
				application software where you could upgrade the space by adding on more
				<abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr> until all socket are filled.

				<h3> Central processing unit (CPU) </h3>
				<img src="../images/Hardware-Components/CPU.PNG" alt="CPU">
				<p>
					It’s called “central processor” considered as the brain of the computer
					as it located as chip on the motherboard and has three main tasks to 
					complete which are manipulating data, carrying out instructions and making
					calculations. The <abbr title="Central Processing Unit"> CPU</abbr> contains electronic circuity which is responsible 
					for running instructions called programs which performs basic input/output
					of computer system as well as it’s responsible for the mathematics 
					operations. The processor must be working with high speed so provide 
					perfect performance and it’s used to be measured in hertz but with 
					nowadays with modern technology needs it’s measuring with gigahertz which
					would increase the performance, better graphics and keep up with new 
					software.

			<h3> Cache memory </h3>
			<p>
				A cache is a temporary storage area where frequently accessed data can be
				stored for rapid access as it placed on the motherboard and integrated 
				directly with the <abbr title="Central Processing Unit"> CPU</abbr> chip and sometimes placed on a separate chip but
				still interconnect with <abbr title="Central Processing Unit"> CPU</abbr> by using separate bus. As well as it’s 
				increasing the performance and allows faster retrieval of data. Therefor
				it’s nearly the most vital component between hardware components as well
				it’s costing massively.

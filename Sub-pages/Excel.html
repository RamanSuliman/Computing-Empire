				<h2> Definition and usage of Spreadsheets </h2>
				<p>
					<img src="../images/Excel/Excel.png" alt="Spreadsheets">
					Spreadsheets play an important role in business life where
					day to day companies use it to solve and organize their data.
					A spreadsheet is organized into rows and columns that wouldn't
					confuse the user to store small or large set of data within a 
					system of cells. A cell is a place where can contain data value
					or calculation operating such as dividing, multiplying or percentages.
					It helps companies or any user to process and manipulate data by 
					providing variety of useful functions such as sorting, filtering or
					controlling all kinds of fonts. The user can use spreadsheet to solve
					any complex problems or organize any system by applying different type
					of formulas, also by displaying their data in suitable graphs so could
					spot the information needed easily.

			<h2> Use of Spreadsheets </h2>
			<h3> Manipulating Complex Data </h3>
			<p>
				<img src="../images/Excel/complex-data.PNG" alt="Spreadsheets">
				Manipulating data in spreadsheet is the process of altering data to
				make it easier to read, as well as organized more to be able to spot
				data needed. Using spreadsheet to processes the function of manipulating
				data can be either by updating, deleting or inserting data from the table.
				By applying those modest manipulating techniques the user would be able 
				to reach any data without getting lost with unorganized data table.
				Examples of manipulating complex data by using spreadsheet:
			</p>
			<p>
				EX 1: Using sorting function to organize your data in alphabetic order 
				where can be from A to Z or the opposite. This function allows the user 
				to find data more effortlessly and manage them based on the order of 
				letters, such as list of employees names or occupations in a company. 
			</p>
			<p>		
				EX 2: Another method of manipulating data would be using “text to columns”
				function. By applying this magical function on your data table the user 
				can split a single column of text into multiple columns. Companies would
				be able to split the full names of their workers into first and surname 
				easily by applying this functions, it helps to display clear details about
				workers. However, the user able to choses the way needed to split columns
				where can be by splitting at each comma, period or other character.

			<h3> Analysing data </h3>
			<p>
				Spreadsheet helps companies which are usually dealing with a massive 
				amount of data daily that  mostly displayed in complicated tables where
				is hard to spot the important data or detect information needed. Therefor,
				analysing of data would make life more easier for every person or 
				organizations that deals with huge amount of data in their work. Overall,
				excel provides variety of different methods to analyse data according 
				user need.
			</p>	
			<p>	
				An example would be using of charts which can result with more than
				a sheet full of number and letters. This function can quickly analyse
				any data user wants to be analysed by displaying those data in different
				smoothly ways that able to be read with effortless. Organization can use
				charts to display the amount of sales received during a week, moth or 
				year. Those data can be viewed by using different type of charts such as,
				Pie Chart where it would display the amount of sales in percentages so 
				the user could gather numerical information. Also, using Line chart would
				be useful to show the trends of categories over time (days, months and 
				years), where it helps organizations to spot in which month they had most
				sales so they could use the same patterns again and get more profit.

			<h2> Supporting Decision Making </h2>
			<h3> Goal Seek </h3>
			<p>
				<img src="../images/Excel/Goal-seek.png" alt="Spreadsheets">
				Is the function that allows the user to set a (goal) in one cell and let
				the spreadsheet to reach it by changing the value in another cell. Which
				means when using a model for setting a target, the user has to start of
				the desired resulted called the target value. An example, a user is 
				planning to buy a new laptop and unable to buy it at the moment, so using
				Goal Seek function would help him to set a target (which is the price of
				the laptop) request the user how much could save per day to reach the 
				target then will tell him how many days would take to cover the cost. The
				model after this step would use the formulas to work out what one of the 
				variables requests to be give that results. When Goal Seek function starts
				working out and run correctly, it constantly tries new values in the 
				variable cell to find a solution to the problem. This will facilitate 
				the work of any manager to give decisions without containing any errors
				because goal seek function would supply them with accurate details based
				on the data been entered by mangers so they definitely would be able to
				give the right decisions.
			</p>
			</div>
			<div>
			<h3> Regression </h3>
			<p>
				Using regression analysis function in spreadsheet is useful tool, where
				it permits the user to analysis data. As it provides a set of statistical
				processes for valuing the relationships between variables, where it 
				contains many techniques for modeling and analyzing a number of variables
				especially when the effort is on the relationship among dependent 
				variables and one or several independent variables. <br>
				Regression analysis is beneficial function in the hands of capable 
				manager where it supports them to give right decisions based on it 
				because it would determine for companies their future profit when graphs
				would show a positive or negative correlation. Also, by explaining the 
				relationship among different variables, this great function would help 
				managers to understand how their business works and make valuable 
				predictions about their progress. An example of this beneficial function 
				may be used for understanding the impact of patrol prices on profitability
				or the effectiveness on companies' sales in term of economic growth.
			</p>
			<p>
				This graph is showing the some examples of regression correlations,
				the first one (Positive correlation) where the trend line can match
				the correlations therefor is positive, the second one(Negative)that
				also negatively match the trend line growth with correlation, and the
				last one(No correlation) would not match either positive or negative
				trend lines because correlation are not in relationship together.

				whether from cost side or investments, where all that would be done by
				setting a different values onto what-if function by determining what the
				company would be focusing on to keep the progression on. 
				<br>
				<img src="../images/Excel/scenarios.png" alt="Spreadsheets">
				Furthermore, what-if can be used to do calculation on project costs
				in case if any values have been changed would be replaced of another
				value based on the option that been added by the user. Applying this
				function would be by using excel software, facing the worksheet and
				select the cells that includes values that the manager wants it be
				changed, then going over and clicking on the “data tap” where the
				what-if function is, after applying those steps it will resolve or 
				find effective solutions. 
			</p>	
			</div>
			<div>
			<h3> Data Mining </h3>
			<p>
				Data mining is the type of function that process over large data placed
				to detect patterns and establish relationship to solve any issue through
				data analysis. As well as it allows companies or businesses to predict
				future trends. Using data mining in spreadsheet would let managers of
				companies to apply effective decisions because this technique have the
				ability to uncover hidden patterns and relationships in data  that are
				able to apply to make predictions that impact business. 
				
				Furthermore exact data mining benefits vary depending on 
				the aim of the business and the industry, but it’s always allow managers 
				to discover frequent patterns that would support their decisions. 
				An example, financial industries of companies uses data mining tool 
				to detect fraud, also some other industries uses data mining to expand
				product safety, detecting quality matters and improving operations.
